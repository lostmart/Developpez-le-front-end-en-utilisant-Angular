# OlympicGamesStarter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.3.

This project is a front-end Angular application that displays Olympic data (e.g., countries, medals, events). It was developed as part of the training "DÃ©veloppez le front-end en utilisant Angular" and aims to demonstrate mastery of Angular concepts and best practices.

## Features

- Load Olympic data from a local JSON file.

- Display list of participating countries.

- Show number of medals per country.

- Present evolution over the years in a line chart.

## Services

- OlympicService: Loads and provides Olympic data via RxJS observables

- ErrorService Handles error display

## Angular Concepts Used

âœ… Angular Modules and Components
âœ… Services with Dependency Injection
âœ… RxJS: BehaviorSubject, Observable, tap, catchError, map
âœ… HTTP requests via HttpClient (even if mock JSON)
âœ… Strong typing via TypeScript
âœ… Component communication (Input / Output if applicable)
âœ… Chart integration using ng2-charts

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

** Prerequisites **

- Node.js â‰¥ 16
- Angular CLI â‰¥ 15

## git clone https://github.com/lostmart/Developpez-le-front-end-en-utilisant-Angular.git

```bash
cd Developpez-le-front-end-en-utilisant-Angular
npm install
ng serve
```


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lostmart/Developpez-le-front-end-en-utilisant-Angular
   cd telesport-olympic-dashboard
   ```

App should run at: http://localhost:4200



## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Where to start

As you can see, an architecture has already been defined for the project. It is just a suggestion, you can choose to use your own. The predefined architecture includes (in addition to the default angular architecture) the following:

- `components` folder: contains every reusable components
- `pages` folder: contains components used for routing
- `core` folder: contains the business logic (`services` and `models` folders)

I suggest you to start by understanding this starter code. Pay an extra attention to the `app-routing.module.ts` and the `olympic.service.ts`.

Once mastered, you should continue by creating the typescript interfaces inside the `models` folder. As you can see I already created two files corresponding to the data included inside the `olympic.json`. With your interfaces, improve the code by replacing every `any` by the corresponding interface.

You're now ready to implement the requested features.

Good luck!
